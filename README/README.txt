-As online multiplayer mode has details that can not be
  so easy to find playing the game, this section has been created.

-Remember to allow the game to be played in the network by using your firewall.

-The online multiplayer mode works only on local area network (LAN).
 In order to play with players outside of your LAN, you must
 use a program to create this kind of network, such as Hamachi.

- This mode can be performed only once per connection. Therefore,please close the game after a multiplayer match and open again for a new match.

1 - Player1 opens the Server Menu (Two Players -> Server);
2 - Player1 click on the "Open Server" button;
3 - Player2 opens the Client menu (Two players -> Client);
4 - Player2 passes the IP and the server port*;
5 - Player2 connects to the server (click on Connect);
6 - Player1 clicks on "Play";

* To pass the IP and the server port, the player in client mode has two options:
